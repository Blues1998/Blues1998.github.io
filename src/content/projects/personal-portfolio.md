## Problem

Most developer portfolios are either overdesigned or under-explained.

## Approach

I focused on clarity, typography, and long-term maintainability using a static
architecture with Markdown-driven content.

## Trade-offs

- No backend means limited interactivity
- Chose restraint over flash

## Artifacts

## Reflection

This site itself is a statement about how I think about software: quiet,
intentional, and maintainable.
