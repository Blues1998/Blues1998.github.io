    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I’m a software engineer who cares deeply about clarity, reliability, and
      long-term maintainability. I enjoy working close to the problem and owning
      systems end-to-end.

    <h2>How I work</h2>

    <ul class="signals">
      <li>• Bias toward simple, understandable systems</li>
      <li>• Prefer small, deliberate trade-offs over abstractions</li>
      <li>• Comfortable working independently or collaboratively</li>
      <li>• Value documentation, naming, and calm codebases</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Outside engineering, I spend time with photography and music — both help
      me slow down and pay attention to detail.
