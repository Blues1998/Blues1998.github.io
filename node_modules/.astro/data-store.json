Instead of asking the reader to visually hunt for the next word, the app removes that cognitive overhead entirely.\n\nThe goal is not speed-reading for its own sake, but **reducing friction** — making it easier to read in imperfect conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Expanding the experience\n\nOnce the stream view was working, a limitation became obvious:  \nsometimes you need context.\n\nTo address this, I added a **page view** that allows users to zoom out and see the surrounding text whenever they want. The reader can fluidly switch between focused consumption and contextual overview without losing their place.\n\nThis dual-mode approach turned out to be essential. Stream view is great for flow; page view is necessary for comprehension and grounding.\n\n---\n\n## Making reading rewarding\n\nI don’t particularly enjoy reading long books. It feels effortful, and I’m easily distracted.
