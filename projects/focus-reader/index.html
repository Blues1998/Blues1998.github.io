</a> </p> </section> <section> <article class="project-content"> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I recently decided to try reading books more consistently and started with <em>Yayati</em> by V. S. Khandekar. I had the PDF on my phone and tried reading it during my evening walks.</p>
<p>That experiment failed quickly.</p>
<p>The road I walk on doesn’t have a proper footpath, and dividing attention between navigating traffic and reading dense text on a phone screen turned out to be impractical. I realised that, for me at least, traditional page-based reading assumes a level of stillness and focus that isn’t always available.</p>
<p>That’s when the idea clicked.</p>
<p>What if reading didn’t require scanning lines of text at all?<br>
What if the content could come to you, one word at a time, at a controlled pace?</p>
<p>That evening, I opened my MacBook and started building Focus Reader.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="core-idea">Core idea</h2>
<p>Focus Reader presents text as a <strong>continuous word stream</strong>, highlighting a single word at a time at a user-defined speed. Instead of asking the reader to visually hunt for the next word, the app removes that cognitive overhead entirely.</p>
<p>The goal is not speed-reading for its own sake, but <strong>reducing friction</strong> — making it easier to read in imperfect conditions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="expanding-the-experience">Expanding the experience</h2>
<p>Once the stream view was working, a limitation became obvious:<br>
sometimes you need context.</p>
<p>To address this, I added a <strong>page view</strong> that allows users to zoom out and see the surrounding text whenever they want. The reader can fluidly switch between focused consumption and contextual overview without losing their place.</p>
<p>This dual-mode approach turned out to be essential. Stream view is great for flow; page view is necessary for comprehension and grounding.</p>

<h2 id="making-reading-rewarding">Making reading rewarding</h2>
<p>I don’t particularly enjoy reading long books. It feels effortful, and I’m easily distracted. Accepting that, rather than fighting it, shaped the next set of decisions.</p>
<p>If the app was going to work for someone like me, it had to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>intuitive</li>
<li>low-effort</li>
<li>subtly motivating</li>
</ul>
<p>To that end, I added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)</strong> highlighting to anchor attention</li>
<li>A <strong>reading progress sidebar</strong> with cues like “~2 minutes to next chapter”</li>
<li>Clear, minimal controls that don’t interrupt flow</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent isn’t gamification, but reassurance — small signals that make continuing feel manageable.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="current-state-and-next-steps">Current state and next steps</h2>
<p>Focus Reader is currently a web app built with React and deployed as a static application under this site.</p>
<p>Next steps I’m considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Porting the app to <strong>Android</strong></li>
<li>Exploring offline reading</li>
<li>Potentially publishing it on the <strong>Play Store</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not it becomes a polished product, the project has already served its purpose: it helped me think deeply about attention, interface friction, and designing for real-world constraints.</p>
